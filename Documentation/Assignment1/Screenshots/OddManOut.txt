Consider Integers in Unsorted array a[0..n-1]
function OddManOut(a, N)
    v = 0
    for every number in the array(i from 0 to n-1 )
        v = v XOR a[i]
    return v
end
Here v gives the resultant number which exactly appears only once in the array.

In this we are just oing the XOR opertation between the intgers in the array, that operation results the number that appears exactly once the unsorted array.
