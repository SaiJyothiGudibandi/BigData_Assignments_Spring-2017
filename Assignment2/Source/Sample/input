Messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent data loss. 
Each broker can handle terabytes of messages without performance impact.
Apache Kafka is an open-source message broker project developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala. 
The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. 
It is, in its essence, a "massively scalable pub/sub message queue architected as a distributed transaction log,"making it highly valuable for enterprise infrastructures to process streaming data.
The design is heavily influenced by transaction logs
